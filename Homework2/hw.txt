The stack chooses a path and follows it until it hits the end, then it jumps back to the most recent fork and follows another path at that fork and just continues until it can't. It does this because it pulls of the newest Coord to follow.

Since the queue pulls the oldest Coord, it ends up jumping around, following each path one Coord at a time
